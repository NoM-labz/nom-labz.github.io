At NoM Labz, we are dedicated to the development and growth of the Zenon Network, a "self evolving planetary scale super organism creating the digital ecosystem of the future. Its fundamentally disruptive protocol goes beyond the blockchain trilemma. Zenon proposes a network that is secure, scalable, and achives true decentralization."  

[Zenon Network](https://zenon.network) is a [self-evolving network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqAequz4mgk) globally deployed to shape digital economies of scale, powered by a worldwide community of innovators. Its fundamentally disruptive protocol goes beyond the blockchain trilemma. Zenon proposes a network that is secure, scalable, and achives true decentralization.

[Zenon.org](https://ask.zenon.wiki/questions/D1V2/what-is-the-difference-between-zenon-network-and-zenon-org/E1Y2) is a separate private organization. While they run several Pillars (validators) within the Zenon Network, their focus is on performance marketing and they use proprietary, closed-source tools.
