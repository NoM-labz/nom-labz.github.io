At NoM Labz, we are dedicated to the development and growth of the Zenon Network, a "self evolving planetary scale super organism creating the digital ecosystem of the future. Its fundamentally disruptive protocol goes beyond the blockchain trilemma. Zenon proposes a network that is secure, scalable, and achives true decentralization."  

[Zenon Network](https://zenon.network) is a self-evolving planetary-scale digital ecosystem powered by a worldwide community of contributors. Its fundamentally disruptive protocol goes beyond the blockchain trilemma. Zenon proposes a blockchain that is secure, scalable, and achieves true decentralization.

[Zenon.org](https://ask.zenon.wiki/questions/D1V2/what-is-the-difference-between-zenon-network-and-zenon-org/E1Y2) is a private organization that runs several Pillars (validators) in the Zenon Network. Their focus is on performance marketing with proprietary tools.
